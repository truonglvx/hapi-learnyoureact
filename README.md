# hapi-learnyoureact

Solutions to the learnyoureact nodeschool workshop: https://github.com/tako-black/learnyoureact,
using Hapi for the server side work instead of Express for anyone curious as to how to use Hapi with React. 

I tried to keep solutions 1-1 with the proposed Express based solutions to serve as a comparison of the two frameworks.

To run:

- clone repository
- cd hapi-learnyoureact
- npm i
- each directory contains a solution to the associated learnyoureact exercise

As always, questions / feedback welcomed.
